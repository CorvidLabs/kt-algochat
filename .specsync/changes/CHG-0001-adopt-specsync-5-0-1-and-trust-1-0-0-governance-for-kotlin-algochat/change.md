# Adopt SpecSync 5.0.1 and Trust 1.0.0 governance for Kotlin AlgoChat

## Intent

Adopt SpecSync 5.0.1 and Trust 1.0.0 governance for Kotlin AlgoChat

## Affected Canonical Specs

- None

## Acceptance Criteria

- SpecSync advisory coverage passes; all four agent integrations are installed; Trust doctor passes; Kotlin tests
- Gradle build
- and JAR packaging pass on JDK 17; the existing JDK 17 and 21 hosted matrix remains green.

## No-spec Rationale

This migration adds governance configuration and CI orchestration without changing the Kotlin protocol implementation; future meaningful implementation changes must add or update canonical specifications.
